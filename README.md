This repository contains code and datasets for Homework 2 of Natural Language Processing at the University of Minnesota, spring 2023.

The goal of the homework is to create a language model for each of 4 datasets from 4 different authors, then determine the author of a test sentence by finding which language model has the lowest perplexity.

Run classifier.py in the command line:

`python classifier.py paths.txt`
